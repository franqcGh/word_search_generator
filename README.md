# WORD SEARCH GENERATOR

This little program is developed for **educational purposes**, as a tool for my job as a teacher.

## v1.0 - First working version

* Takes a maximum number of 20 words
* By default returns a matrix (python list) of 20 columns and 20 rows
* Everything is executed by console only
* Entered words by using the word_list.txt
* Write one word per line

## v2.0 - Second working version

* A loop due to writing the same word in different directions was errased
* This version is way faster than the first one
